One of the potential pit falls is to differentiate potential attacks with genuine user error. For example with low rate DDOS attacks, a login page could be repeatedly loaded, however this could also be due to a user forgetting their password.This is why the research needs multiple indication of intent before classing this an attack.  

%People may be un-willing to give data
Due to the sensitive nature of the website logs, website owners maybe unwilling to give these logs for analysis. If there is lack of data then website could be setup to get log files however this data may be not as desirable as it would be simulated. In addition to this, the websites that are analysed may not have been attacked.Therefore it will be harder to prove if the forumla can detect attacks.

%There maybe no attacks in data
