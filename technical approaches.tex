The appoaches used in this work will be combing esiting techiques in a new way there will be a backend database that will hold data about the IP adresses of known bots so that thease can return a risk of 0. 

Another table will hold risks of http status coodes as  seen in apendix B, by keeping the values in the database table, it is easier to modify the risk. Furthermore another table holds signatures known attacks so that this can be run against the data. This makes it very quick to add new attacks to the formula.

The data analysed will be the apache common log format. This data is read into the formula and then stored within software to allow to be analysed. 

To be able to identify the country of origin IP address, the maxmind geoip database is used then each country is assigned risk wieghting within a seperate database. The same process is used for the network risk.by using the maxmind databases, it ensures that the IP information is always up to date.
