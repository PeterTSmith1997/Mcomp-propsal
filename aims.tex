The aim of this research is to build upon work carried out as part of a 2019 Study by Smith P. looking at a  formula approach to detecting risks posed by website traffic. The work done by Smith attempted to use website log files to detect suspicious activity on a website. This work will collect more data to prove the accuracy of this approach. As well as expanding the number of data points to detect attacks for example the network an IP belongs to and the user agents. The study by Smith P. only has a relatively small data set to it is hard to draw any wider conclusions about the accuracy of the technique proposed, therefore one of the primary aims of this study is to collect a wider data set.
