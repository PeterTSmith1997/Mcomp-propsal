%The aim of this research is to build upon work carried out as part of a 2019 Study by Smith P. looking at a  formula approach to detecting risks posed by website traffic. The work done by Smith attempted to use website log files to detect suspicious activity on a website. This work will collect more data to prove the accuracy of this approach. As well as expanding the number of data points to detect attacks for example who the network an IP belongs to and the user agents. The study by Smith P. only has a relatively small data set to it is hard to draw any wider conclusions about the accuracy of the technique proposed.

This research aims to look at a  new appoarch to attack detction, as was shown in the literature review there has been very litttle work do with real data to detect attacks on websites, therefore one of the main aims is the collection of real data.
